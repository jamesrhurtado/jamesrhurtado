## Hey, I'm James

so i am james, i am (almost) a software engineer. i'm not sure what i can tell about me other than what you can see in my [portfolio](https://jamesrhurtado.github.io/) (probably needs a refresh). i just code, share, and attend events (as speaker sometimes). that's it in a nutshell. oh, and i also share content on instagram when i have free time (not an influencer but i like sharing little pieces about me).

**Social Media:**
you can reach out in case you have any questions. i have helped lots of people and i'll be happy to help you too (it's gonna depend on my availability tho).

so my work is on my GitHub (always capitalizing the G and the H or they'll kick me out of the [GitHub Campus Expert program](https://githubcampus.expert/jamesrhurtado/), kidding… i think). you can see some of my repositories there (although some are private because of side projects i could never finish). others are in my portfolio and yeah, that's it.

i'm not good at designing so this will be a work in progress. for now i can tell you i work mostly with python, typescript, javascript, react, sql, and tools like docker, azure, git, github. at least that is what i'm using now for different projects.
